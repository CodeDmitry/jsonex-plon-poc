1. no circular structures, eg the following is not allowed to be encoded(or rather, it is allowed, but don't blame us for the infinite loop, your problem).
    var f = {};
    f.f = f;
    
2. only supported types:
    1. Number, both integral and fractional, but not infinity nor negative infinity.
    2. String, with only \n being allowed escape code.
    3. Boolean
    4. null
    5. Function, inheritence chain is not preserved.
    6. Object(as a hash table) of string to supported types only,
        only properties discoverable with "for in" loops are supported.
    7. Array of supported types only.
    
3. some types which are not supported, or undefined behavior:
    1. the `undefined` type
    2. NaN
    3. Symbol
    4. Set
    5. Uint8Array, Uint16Array, Uint32Array, BigUint64Array,
        or any other other kind of non-Array Array type.

4. it must work on every javascript version, from Microsoft JScript,
    to nodejs, to old nashorn javascript before oracle removed it,
    web javascript, as well as any other javascript version that is worthy of being
    called a javascript version.
    
5. object must be wrapped in '()', for JScript compatibility, eg
    ({
        "a": 2,
        "=": 3
    })
